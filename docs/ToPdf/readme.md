##### ToPdf
ToPdf is a tool to convert markdown files into a single pdf file.

##### How to use
Clone repo, open solution in visual studio and run.\
While we tried to make ToPdf into a general solution that works for any project, that unfortunately ended up not working out and some modification might be needed to make it work for other projects (which is fine btw, you may use this for you own projects).

> Note that any images must be uploaded to github before running, since local images are not supported, and will be downloaded from github.
