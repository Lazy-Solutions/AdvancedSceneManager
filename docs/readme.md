## Advanced Scene Manager documentation

You may access documentation by switching branches:\
[1.9](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/AdvancedSceneManager/tree/1.9/readme.md)\
[2.0](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/AdvancedSceneManager/tree/2.0/readme.md)

## Notice
Upgrading from ASM 1.9 (also called legacy) to 2.x cannot be done automatically. This is due to the fact that 2.0 is a rebuild, and Unity do not provide any tools for dealing with this, so now we are stuck in a situation where the only solution to upgrade is to:
1. Delete 'AdvancedSceneManager' folder
2. Re-install ASM from asset store
3. Update to patches if desired
4. Import scenes, and setup collections once more.

> Note that this is also recommended for all asset store updates.\
> \
> All patches that match the major and minor version of the ASM version you have installed, can be installed directly though.
