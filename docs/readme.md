## Advanced Scene Manager documentation

You may access documentation by switching branches:\
[1.9](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/AdvancedSceneManager/tree/1.9/readme.md)\
[2.0](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/AdvancedSceneManager/tree/2.0/readme.md)

## Notice
Upgrading from ASM 1.9 (also called legacy) to 2.x cannot be done automatically. This is due to the fact that 2.0 is a rebuild, and Unity do not provide any tools for dealing with this, so now we are stuck in a situation where the only solution to upgrade is to:
1. Delete 'AdvancedSceneManager' folder
2. Re-install ASM from asset store
3. Enter legacy mode, to keep your profiles and collections, at the dialog window that should pop-up.

> Upgrading from legacy mode to 2.0 proper, will unfortunately require a re-setup of ASM, all profiles and collections will be deleted, and scenes will need to be re-imported into ASM.
