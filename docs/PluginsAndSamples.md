#### Package Manager
The 'Plugins and Samples' package, available in the Unity package manager, can be used to: view asm version, easily install plugins and browse samples.

> Note that there is currently a bug, where pressing 'Import into project' might not actually start downloading, when this occurs the easiest way to get unity to react, is to focus another window on your system, then activate unity again, and the download should trigger.
