# Scene bindings

Scene bindings are used to open collections or scenes through a key or button binding.

[Collections](Scene%20collections.md) can be bound using the [collection popup](Scene%20manager%20window.md#collection-popup).\
[Standalone scenes](Standalone%20scenes.md) can be bound using the [scene popup](Scene%20manager%20window.md#scene-popup).

_Interaction_ defines how the collection or scene responds to input â€” whether it opens only, toggles, or closes on release.
* **Open**: Only open, don't close.
* **Hold**: Keep open when button held down, then close on release.
* **Toggle**: Toggle scene open or closed on button down.
