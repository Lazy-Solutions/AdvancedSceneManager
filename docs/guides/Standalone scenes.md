# Standalone Scenes

Standalone scenes are scenes that aren't part of any scene collection but should still be included in the build. These scenes are managed via a special dynamic collection in ASM called the **Standalone** collection.

This collection ensures that such scenes are tracked and included in builds, even though they are not tied to a specific group.

## Startup Behavior

Standalone scenes can be configured to open during game startup or when entering play mode in the editor. These settings are controlled through the **Scene popup**, accessible via the menu button on the scene field.

> These startup settings are especially useful for utility scenes such as overlays, persistent UI, or manager systems.
## Input Bindings

Standalone scenes support [scene bindings](Scene%20bindings.md), allowing them to be opened and closed in response to user input.

This makes them ideal for UI elements like pause menus, scoreboards, or debug windowsâ€”any content that you may want to toggle using keys like Escape or Tab.

To bind a key to a standalone scene:
1. Open the scene menu.
2. Scroll to the **Input Binding** section.
3. Select your key and interaction mode:
   - **Open**: Opens scene, doesn't close it.
   - **Hold**: Opens while the key is held, closes on release.
   - **Toggle**: Opens or closes on each press.
## Usage Notes

- The standalone collection cannot be deleted and is always available in every profile.
- Scenes in this collection can be set as **persistent**, meaning they won't close automatically when switching collections.
