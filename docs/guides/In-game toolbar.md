# In-game toolbar

The in-game toolbar provides some debugging tools, especially useful in builds, relating to scene management.

#### How do I use it?
The easiest way is to add it to [standalone](Standalone%20scenes.md), then add a [scene binding](Scene%20bindings.md) to it. This is done by default when creating a new profile, assuming [Input system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/index.html) is installed *(Scene bindings only support [InputSystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/index.html))*. It is bound to tab, by default.

#### What can I do with it?

The in-game toolbar allows you to:
* Restart the game.
* Re-open currently open [collection](Scene%20collections.md).
* Quit game.
* See if ASM is currently working (see [ASM scene operations](Scene%20operations.md)).
* List open [scenes](Scenes.md).
