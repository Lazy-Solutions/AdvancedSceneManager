Support packages are packages that can be downloaded that either add additional functionality, like [addressables package](AddressablesSupport), or they can add example projects.

The example projects are designed to be as non-destructive as possible, and installing them in an existing project should not pose any problems but please make sure everything is backed up before downloading any, just in case.

Also remember to switch profile, since each example has its own profile.

These packages can be downloaded through the [package manager](PackageManager):
