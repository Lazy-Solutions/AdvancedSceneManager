# Scenes

Scenes in ASM are represented as [ScriptableObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html), this is to provide a simple drag drop interface for scenes.

To retrieve a reference to a ASM scene, when all you've got is a unity scene struct, you may use any of the following:

``` csharp 
public class Test : MonoBehaviour
{
	
	void Start()
	{
		//Returns null if not imported, or found.
		var scene1 = this.ASMScene();
		var scene2 = this.gameObject.ASMScene();
		var scene3 = this.gameObject.scene.ASMScene();
		
		//All the above also have overloads like this
		if (this.ASMScene(out var scene4))
		{ }
		
		//Equivivalent to SceneManager.runtime.activeScene.
		var activeScene = UnityEngine.SceneManagement.SceneManager.GetActiveScene().ASMScene();

	}

}
```

## Drag-and-drop can be used for the following scenarios:
### Add scene to a collection, or replace existing scene field.

### UnityEvent

[Button](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/script-Button.html) On Click () handler for example:

![](../image/button-click-scene-open.png)
### Scripts:

  ```csharp
  using AdvancedSceneManager.Models;
  
  public class OpenScene
  {
	
	public Scene scene;

	public void Open()
	{
		scene.Open();
	}

  }
  ```

## Importing

Scenes must be imported to be used in ASM. You can do so by pressing the notification in the scene manager window.

![](../image/scene-import-notification.png)

Scenes can be unchecked to not import them at this time.

![](../image/import-scene-popup.png)

Scenes may be blacklisted so they don't show up. Blacklisting a folder will result in all scenes inside the folder, including subfolders, will also be ignored.

![](../image/blacklist.png)

Finally, just press import, and the imported scenes will now be usable in ASM.

Blacklist can be configured in [settings](Scene%20manager%20window.md#assets-page).
## Persistent scenes

Persistent scenes are scenes that do not automatically close when a collection is closed. This can be specified in the [scene popup](Scene%20manager%20window.md#scene-popup).
## Preloading

A scene can be preloaded by calling `Scene.Preload()`, or by using [scene helper](Scene%20helper.md). Only one scene may be preloaded at a time, and no other scene operations can occur while one is, *this is a unity limitation*.

```csharp
using AdvancedSceneManager.Models;
using UnityEngine;

public class PreloadTrigger : MonoBehaviour
{

    public Scene sceneToPreload;

    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if (!sceneToPreload.isOpen && !sceneToPreload.isPreloaded)
            sceneToPreload.Preload();
    }

    void OnTriggerExit(Collider other)
    {
        //User exited trigger, and since FinishPreload() has
        //not been called if .isPreloaded is true, that means
        //the user went backwards
        if (sceneToPreload.isPreloaded)
            sceneToPreload.DiscardPreload();
    }

    //Called from other, overlapping, trigger
    public void FinishPreload()
    {
        if (sceneToPreload.isPreloaded)
            sceneToPreload.FinishPreload();
    }

}
```

The currently preloaded scene can be retrieved statically by:\
`AdvancedSceneManager.SceneManager.preloadedScene;`
## Scene merging

Scenes can be merged by ctrl selecting two or more scenes in the [scene manager window](Scene%20manager%20window.md), and right clicking, then selecting 'merge scenes...'.

![](../image/scene-context-menu.png)

Scenes can be merged programmatically as well:\
*Only usable in editor*\
`SceneUtility.MergeScenes(targetScene, sceneToMergeIntoTargetScene); //Can accept multiple scenes in second argument`

## Scene splitting

Scenes can be split up into multiple by selecting two or more [GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html) in the hierarchy.

![](../image/scene-split-menu.png)
![](../image/scene-split-result.png)

Scenes can be split up programmatically as well:\
*Only usable in editor*\
`SceneUtility.MoveToNewScene(gameObject); //Moves current game object into a new scene, method supports multiple objects`
