<p><br></p>
<p>The in-game toolbar provides some convenient debugging tools for builds.
While this might not have much use in editor, it may be invaluable when debugging builds.</p>
<p>The in-game toolbar is enabled by default, and can be toggled on or off in the settings tab of the <a href="SceneManagerWindow.html">scene manager window</a>.</p>
