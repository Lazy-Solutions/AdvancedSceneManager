## Scene manager window

<br/>

The Scene Manager Window can be used to manage the [SceneCollections](SceneCollection.md) (commonly referred to as collection) and scenes in a project, and also the behavior of Advanced Scene Manager.

The scene manager window can be opened through:<br/>

### Create new collection
Press ![](../image/new-collection.png) button to create a new [collection](SceneCollection.md).

### Collection properties

![](../image/collection-edit-menu.png)

> Title<br/>
The title of this collection.

<br/>
> Extra data:<br/>
A scriptable object that is to be associated with this collection, retrievable in code by SceneCollection.ExtraData<T>() or SceneCollection.extraData.

<br/>
> Active scene<br/>
The scene that should be activated after collection has been opened.

<br/>
> Startup option<br/>
Can be one of the following values:<br/>
 Auto: Open if this collection is the uppermost collection in the list that is enabled. (default)<br/>
 Do not open: Don't open this collection during startup.<br/>
 Open: Open this collection during startup.<br/>
 Open as persistent: Open this collection during startup, and flag each scene within as [persistent](../api/AdvancedSceneManager.Utility.PersistentUtility.html) (aka [SceneCloseBehavior.KeepOpenAlways](#tags)).

<br/>
> Loading thread priority:<br/>
Automatically set [Application.LoadingThreadPriority](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-backgroundLoadingPriority.html) to specified value when this collection is opened (and is reset when done).<br/>
This field will be disabled if 'Background Loading Priority' is disabled in settings tab.

<br/>
> Loading Screen<br/>
The loading screen to use when opening or closing this collection.

### Add or remove scenes / collection
Scenes can be added to a [collection](SceneCollection.md) by pressing the ![](../image/+.png) button on its header, [Scenes](Scene.md) and [SceneAsset](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneAsset.html) can then be dragged onto the scene fields.

The ![](../image/-.png) button on a collection header or scene row can be used to remove a collection or scene.

### Reorder
Hold and drag on ![](../image/=.png) button and drag up and down to reorder collections or scenes.

### Open buttons
> Tip: Holding shift when using any of the following buttons, will force open any scenes tagged with SceneOpenBehavior.DoNotOpenWithCollection.

![](../image/â–¶.png) button can be used to open a collection in play mode.

![](../image/open.png) button can be used to open a collection or scene, closing all other scenes.

![](../image/+.png) and ![](../image/-.png) buttons can be used to open or close collections or scenes additively. Collections can only be opened additively in editor, outside of play mode.

### Selection, bake lightmaps, combine scenes

[Scenes](Scene.md) and [collections](SceneCollection.md) can be selected by holding ctrl and clicking on it in the scenes tab.

When more than one scene are selected (collections count for all its containing scenes), the ![](../image/bake-lightmaps.png) button will appear, this will allow you to bake lightmaps for all the selected [scenes](Scene.md), and when a [collection](SceneCollection.md)  is selected, all [scenes](Scene.md) within  will be included.

When more than one scene are selected (collections do not count), the ![](../image/combine-scenes.png) button will appear, this will allow you to quickly [merge scenes together](Scene.md#scene-merge), note that this cannot be undone, except for using the [split scene utility](Scene.md#scene-split).

![](../image/selection.png)

## Tags
Tags can be used to specify custom open or close behavior, when opened or closed through a collection.

Press ![](../image/new-tag.png) button to create a new tag.

![](../image/tags.png)

> Title<br/>
The title of the tag.

<br/>
> Close behavior:
- Close
  - (default) Closes scene like normal.
- Keep open if next collection also contains scene
  - Keeps the scene open when opening a collection that also contains the scene, otherwise close.
- Keep open always
  - Persistent, ASM will never close automatically.

<br/>
> Open behavior:
  - (default) Open normally
    - Open like normal
  - Do not open in collection
    - Do not open this scene automatically when the associated collection is opened

## Settings
The settings tab can be used change behavior of advanced scene manager.

![](../image/settings.png)

> [Profile](Profile.md):<br/>
The active [Profile](Profile.md) in ASM.

### Options

> [Splash screen](SplashScreen.md):<br/>
The custom [splash screen](SplashScreen.md) to display during startup, plays after Unity's splash screens, if enabled. Provides more flexibility than Unity's splash screen since ours is merely implemented as scenes with a script using IEnumerator callback.

<br/>
> [Startup loading screen](LoadingScreen.md):<br/>
The [loading screen](LoadingScreen.md) that will be used during startup.

<br/>
> [Loading screen](LoadingScreen.md):<br/>
The [loading screen](LoadingScreen.md) that will be used for [collections](SceneCollection.md) that are set to use the default loading screen.

<br/>
> Startup scene:<br/>
 This is the scene that should open first in build. Don't change this unless you know what you're doing.

<br/>
> Background loading priority:<br/>
If enabled, automatically set [Application.backgroundLoadingPriority](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-backgroundLoadingPriority.html) during startup.<br/>
Note that collections can also specify loading priority during open, but that is only temporary, and value will be reset back to this when done.<br/>
Disable this if you are using another asset which relies on managing this setting by itself.

<br/>
> Create camera during startup:<br/>
Automatically create camera during startup, if no main camera is found.

<br/>
> Use [default pause screen](PauseScreenUtility.md):<br/>
ASM has a [default pause screen](PauseScreenUtility.md) for those times when you build and then forget that no one has created a pause screen yet, forcing you to alt-f4, then restart again. This toggles default pause screen on or off.

<br/>
> Include fade loading screen:<br/>
 Includes the default fade loading screen in build.

### Local

> Open collection when SceneAsset opened:<br/>
 Attempts to find and open an associated collection when a SceneAsset is opened in editor.

<br/>
 > Open scenes when created using scene field:<br/>
When creating scenes using 'New' button in collections, should we open the scene afterwards?

<br/>
 > Allow manual editing of build settings:<br/>
 Allows editing build settings, note that this might make things weird in build, so please make sure to test everything properly when using this.

<br/>
 > Use save dialog when creating scenes:<br/>
 There are two ways to create scenes (when using 'New' button in collections):<br/>
 Checking this make ASM use the first option.<br/>
    - Opening save file dialog.<br/>
    - Using project window, which puts scene in current folder and prompts for name.<br/>

<br/>
 > Save action when using ASM play button:<br/>
 When any open scene has changes what should we do?:<br/>
     - Do Nothing<br/>
     - Save: Save without prompting<br/>
     - Prompt: Prompt using regular dialog, if user presses no, changes will be discarded.

### Log

> Pointless opening of [collections](SceneCollection.md) during startup:<br/>
Enables or disables warnings during startup that a [collection](SceneCollection.md) was opened, then closed because another [collection](SceneCollection.md) was also set to open during startup, and no [scene](Scene.md) within was persistent.

<br/>
> Deleting temp Build:<br/>
Enables or disables a message that indicates that the temp build was deleted after process ended, this is mostly just useful for debugging when issues cause folder to not be deleted and is a quick way to know if this feature works as intended or not.

### In-game toolbar

 > Display ingame toolbar:<br/>
 Determines whatever the in-game toolbar should be enabled upon entering play mode, or build.

<br/>
 > Display in editor:<br/>
 Should it be enabled in editor?

<br/>
 > Expanded by default:<br/>
 Should the in-game toolbar is start as expanded?

### Appearance

### Plugins and samples
The package manager can be used to install plugins for ASM. It also contains links to samples on github.

![](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/AdvancedSceneManager/raw/main/image/plugins-and-samples.PNG?raw=true)

The following plugins are currently available:<br/>
[plugin.asm.locking](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/plugin.asm.locking)<br/>
[plugin.asm.addressables](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/plugin.asm.addressables)

Experimental:<br/>
[plugin.asm.cross-scene-references](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/plugin.asm.cross-scene-references)

### Dynamic collections
 Dynamic collections allow you to automatically include all scenes in a folder (including subfolders) in build.<br/>
 Dynamic collections override blacklisted scenes.
