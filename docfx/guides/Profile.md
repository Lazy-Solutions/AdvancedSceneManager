## Profiles

<br/>

A profile stores the [settings](SceneManagerWindow.md#settings), [collections](SceneCollection.md) and any [standalone](SceneManager.md#standalone-scene-manager) [scenes](Scene.md) that should be included in build in ASM. Profiles are easily swappable in [SceneManagerWindow](SceneManagerWindow.md#settings) and active profile is saved locally, which means that different members of a team can use their own profiles and then the project might use a profile specifically for build or release, if desired.
