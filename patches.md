## Patches for Advanced Scene Manager

Patches are partial updates that are too important to have our users wait for.

Patches only support newest version on asset store. When a new asset store version is released, all patches will be cleared, as they are included in the package.

Patches can be found here:\
[https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/AdvancedSceneManager/releases](https://github.com/Lazy-Solutions/AdvancedSceneManager/releases)\

#### Notices:
> Some users seem to have an issue where importing patch will just present message that all files are already in project. This is most likely due to our combine .unitypackage tool, which we used to combine patches. We no longer use this tool and have updated our patch tool to support tracking changed files, and will as a result package all changed files by default, no combining or manually keeping track of files needed.
> 
> Unfortunately for already affected users, the only workaround seems to be:
> - Uninstall ASM (delete Assets/AdvancedSceneManager folder).
> - Reinstall from asset store.
> - Import patch.
